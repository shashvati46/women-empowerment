          <h3 >  Model self-acceptance</h3> <br>

           <p> Avoid talking about your body hang-ups in front of her. 
            Try to eat well, exercise and demonstrate a positive body image.So show her that you accept and love yourself.
          </p><br>
          <h3> Don’t focus on her looks </h3><br>

            <p>While it might seem harmless to tell  girls how 
            cute, pretty or beautiful they are, it can lead them
             to develop a sense of self-worth that’s dependent
             upon their appearance. As adorable as it might
             be to dress up a toddler in tutus and post photos
             on Insta or to stock a first-grader’s closet with princess 
            dresses, remember that these messages aren’t empowering for
             her. Try to use words such as “determined”, “creative”, 
            “hard-working”, “brave” and “kind” to describe her instead.</p><br>
            <h3> Let her be adventurous and rowdy </h3><br>

               <p> When a little boy climbs a tree and shouts like a pirate from the top, 
                we barely bat an eye. But if a girl does the same thing, we tell her that
                 she’s being too loud and to calm down.But that’s doing her a disservice
                 because it’s teaching her to dim her light and be a “good girl” while all
                 the boys her age are encouraged to be wild and free. Let’s allow our girls to be wild and free, too.
                </p> <br>
                <h3> Talk to her about feminism </h3><br>

                    <p>According to Biddulph, when your daughter is worrying about boys, her body,
                    bullies or pursuing interests she’s told are “for boys”, knowing about the
                    feminist movement can help her get through.“Realizing that this has been a battle
                    fought for over a century and in every corner of the world, that it is not just her,
                    has been found to be a great mental health boost, because it makes you angry instead
                    of frightened or inadequate,” he toldThe Independent. “You feel part of something larger.”
                    </p> <br>
 <h3> Help her find her passion</h3> <br>

<p>Psychologist Peter L. Benson called it a child’s “spark” – an interest, passion or gift that,
if nurtured, gives their life meaning and purpose. He even believed that children whose sparks
have been ignited are more likely to steer clear of drugs, alcohol, violence and other negative   
pathways. Whether it’s soccer, painting, creating things, playing the violin or caring for animals  
help her find what she truly loves doing and encourage her to pursue it.</p> <br> <br>
                        
<h3>Reject the binary </h3><br>

<p>Repeat after me: It’s humankind. Not mankind.

  It might not seem like a big deal, but terms such as  “male or female” and “women or men” exclude non-binary and intersex people who don’t fall into any of these categories. 
  
  Diverse gender identities have always existed in every culture, and ensuring the rights of transgender, genderqueer, non-binary individuals and more—who often face horrifying
  
   violence and discrimination across the world—is an inherent part of gender equality. 
  
  Everyday language plays a huge role in breaking gender stereotypes and rejecting the binary of “male and female”. 
  
  Instead of using phrases like “ladies and gentlemen” or “boys and girls”, swap in a gender-neutral term like “folks,” 
  
  “children,” or “y’all.” These little changes can go a long way toward shifting cultural perceptions of gender. 
  
  Don’t assume you know someone’s pronoun or gender. One way to open up a conversation is to give your own: include 
  
  your pronouns when you introduce yourself or add them to your email signature or your social media profiles. Gender 
  
  pronouns include: she/her, he/him, they/them, 
  
  When referring to a person using the pronouns, gender and name that they use to identify themselves, do not refer to or reveal a 
  
  person’s sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status without their consent.

 <h3>Amplify feminist books, movies and more </h3><br>
 <p>The next time you’re browsing the bookstore or settling in for a movie night, consider something written or directed by women (and for women). 

Movies, books, newspapers, podcasts, and other popular mediums have lasting effects on cultural perceptions of gender, offering women a powerful platform to share their stories and perspectives. Yet, the film and publishing industries remain heavily male-dominated, and popular narratives commonly portray women as one-dimensional characters or sex objects—or else exclude them altogether. An analysis of popular films across 11 countries found, for example, that only 23 per cent featured a female protagonist—a number that closely mirrored the percentage of female filmmakers (21 per cent). 

You can amplify the voices of the women and feminists rewriting this narrative by watching, listening, reading and investing in the media they produce.</p><br>
<h3>Teach girls their worth</h3><br>
<p>Little princess. Vulnerable. Bossy.

  Before even hitting puberty, girls across the world already carry internalized beliefs about their place, worth and role in society as dependant, vulnerable or incapable and are told to act accordingly, reinforcing gender stereotypes and keeping girls from realizing their full potential.
  
  It’s hard to unlearn these kinds of beliefs. That’s why it’s so important to start addressing them early. Remind girls in your life that they are strong, capable and deserving of the same respect as boys. Make sure they know they are more than their appearance: praise them for their intelligence, strength, leadership, athleticism and so much more. 
  
  Encourage girls to speak out and assert themselves. Counter narratives and language that discourage them to do so: say they are “bold,” not “bossy.” Show them their thoughts matter by asking their opinions and listening when they speak. And, if you are a parent or teacher, invest in toys, books and movies that are gender-neutral. Show girls the possibilities of their potential and allow them to play as they wish. Let them know that there is no wrong or right way to be a girl.
